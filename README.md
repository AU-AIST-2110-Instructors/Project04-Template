# Part 4: Creative Extension

In this final part, you’ll have the opportunity to take everything you've learned and make the escape adventure game your own. Now that you’ve implemented a solid structure with room navigation, key collection, and locked doors, it’s time to expand the game in any direction you like.

This part does not include formal tests. Instead, your game will be evaluated based on its code structure, organization, effective use of data structures, and the creativity and functionality of the features you implement.

Your game *must* implementing at least:

- **A new house or environment design/layout:** Expand or redesign the current environment to include new areas, rooms, or locations.

- **A new mechanic:** Implement at least new game mechanic. 
    *The suggestions below are to give you some inspiration, you don't need to implement all of them. You can choose ideas from the list or come up with your own.* For example:
    - Puzzles and challenges that reveal codes or riddles
    - Interactive objects that require searching for keys in places like closets or drawers 
    - Timed challenges such as locking doors or escape missions
    - Inventory system for managing and using items
    - NPCs and enemies that provide clues or pose threats
    - Branching endings with multiple escape routes and outcomes to enhance replayability.

- **A narrative:** Develop a background story for the game that provides context and motivation for the player's actions, enriching the overall game atmosphere.

That is the minimum, you can implement as much features as you want.

Don't forget to give a name for your game (and maybe even create an [ascii art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) logo).

**Important: The game design and implementation should reflect your own creativity and be developed entirely through your individual efforts. During the presentation, you will be asked to explain the game and describe how it was implemented.**

## (NEW) Presentation
On 11/25, you will present your game to the class, showcasing it to both your classmates and the instructor. Details on the presentation format will be detailed in class and announcements.

## Getting Started
- You can either start by copying the solution of part 3 posted in D2L ([availale here](https://lms.augusta.edu/d2l/le/content/475120/viewContent/3439664/View) on 11/20), or continue on your own implementation (make sure to copy and paste your solution into this repository).


## How to Submit

- Use the VS code Source Control Tab to submit your assignment:
    - Click on the `+` sign next to the files you want to include, in this case `escape.py`
    - Write a commit message, e.g., "Finished with part 4."
    - Select "Commit and Push".
- Alternativally, you can use git to add, commit, and push your changes:
    ```bash
    git add escape.py
    git commit -m "Finished with part 4."
    git push
    ```

## General Tips
- Make sure to frequently save and push your changes to your GitHub repository.
- Test your code after each significant modification.

## Final Notes
By the end of this part, your escape game will be a unique creation, reflecting your personal style and creativity. Have fun, and push the limits of what you can do with the game!
